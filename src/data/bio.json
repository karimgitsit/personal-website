  "bio": "Welcome, I'm Karim.\n\natm I'm building DeFi products and experimenting with vibecoding.\n\nIn the past I have:\n- Contributed to Messari Research (a research and data firm in the crypto industry).\n- Worked at Outlier Ventures (an early stage crypto investor and accelerator) where I was a token designer for 2 years. This entailed advising early stage crypto protocols on incentive design, product, and token economics.\n- During the last few years I have angel invested in over 15 startups, only half of which I deeply regret.\n\nMy current passion is building in DeFi, where I embrace the pseudonymous nature of the culture. I have so far:\n- Led a permissionless leverage protocol which garned over $5m in pre-deposits, and did over $250k in protocol revenue within 2 weeks of launching.\n- Won 2 hackathons in first place, earning over $80k in prize money (which i quickly and unsuccessfully invested in trying to grow those products).\n- Built multiple iterations of an economic game that uses MEV to bootstrap a prize pool, and has done over $150k in game volume.\n- Strategised and executed DeFi liquidity strategies to garner more product and token liquidity for different protocols to build healthier liquidity.\n\nI am still yield farming, advising, and building in DeFi.",
