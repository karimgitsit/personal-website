  "bio": "I'm Karim, atm I'm building DeFi products and experimenting with vibecoding.\n\nIn the past I have worked at Outlier Ventures, where I was a token designer for 2 years. This entailed advising early stage crypto protocols on incentive design, product, and token economics. During my time there and since then, I have also angel invested in over 15 startups, only half of which I deeply regret\n\nMy current passion is building in DeFi, where I embrace the pseudonymous nature of the culture. I have so far:\n- Led a permissionless leverage protocol which garned over $5m in pre-deposits, and did over $250k in protocol revenue within 2 weeks of launching\n- Won 2 hackathons in first place, earning over $80k in prize money (which i quickly and unsuccessfully invested in trying to grow those products)\n- Built multiple iterations of an economic game that uses MEV to bootstrap a prize pool, and has done over $150k in game volume\n\nI am still tinkering, yield farming, and building DeFi products",
